# 2014 CMPT 413 Homework and Project Archive

These are some of the homework assignments and the final project I completed in 2014's Natural Language Processing class taught by Dr. Anoop Sarkar at Simon Fraser University.

The overall goal of this class was to create a working machine translation system, which my team of two succeeded in doing.

Training data was not included in the repository as I am unsure of who holds the rights to them and proprietary code provided by our professor and TA were also not included.

Reports written in LaTeX have been provided in each assignment/project folder to explain the code and its usage. They are also provided in PDF format for those who do not want to compile the reports themselves.
